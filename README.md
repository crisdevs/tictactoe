# Tic Tac Toe Game!
This is a Tic Tac Toe game I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a great way to practice my Object Oriented JavaScript skills and I had a lot of fun creating it.

To check out my project here is the live site:https://crisdevs.github.io/tictactoe/

Hope enjoyed!
